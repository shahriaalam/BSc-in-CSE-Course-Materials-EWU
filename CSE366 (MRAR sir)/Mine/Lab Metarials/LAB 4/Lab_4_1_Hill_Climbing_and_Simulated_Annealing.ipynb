        "The Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) is a classic algorithmic problem in the field of computer science and operations research. It is a problem that falls under the category of combinatorial optimization. The challenge involves a salesperson who must travel to a set of cities, visiting each city exactly once, and then return to the origin city. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that accomplishes this, minimizing the total distance traveled or the total cost incurred during the trip.\n",

        "**Problem Statement**\n",
        "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the traveling salesperson seeks to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.\n",

        "**Key Components**\n",
        "Cities: A set of N cities that the salesperson needs to visit.\n",
        "Distance: A metric that represents the cost, time, or distance between each pair of cities. This can be represented as a distance matrix where the element at the ith row and jth column represents the distance from city i to city j.\n",
        "\n",
        "Route: An ordered list of cities representing the path taken by the salesperson. The route starts and ends at the same city, visiting all other cities exactly once.\n",

        "**Objectives**\n",
        "\n",
        "Primary Objective: To minimize the total travel distance or cost.\n",

        "**Challenges**\n",
        "\n",
        "The TSP is known for its computational complexity. As the number of cities increases, the number of possible routes grows factorially, making exhaustive search impractical for even moderately sized problems.\n",

        "The TSP has practical applications in logistics, planning, and the optimization of transportation networks.\n",
